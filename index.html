    <h2>Week 1: Proposal</h2>
    <p>Carrying on from last quarter in creating a website for our former client, Michele Martin, we are now focusing on converting that website into a Wordpress site.</p>
    <p>The Wordpress site will allow the now pseudo-client to edit the content of the site without requiring assistance from the design team.</p>
    <p>The team has made the decision to drop the real world client (Martin) due to the class expectations and limited communication between the client and design team.</p>

    <h2>Week 2: Timeline</h2>
